                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We believe in a transparent pricing model that works in the client's favor.</p>
                        <p><strong>Residential Projects:</strong> We typically charge based on Square Footage.</p>
                        <p><strong>Large-Scale/Commercial Projects:</strong> We charge a percentage of the total
                            construction cost. We find this structure creates the most affordable and fair balance for
                            our clients depending on the scale of the work.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is the initial consultation free?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        We charge a nominal fee for our first meeting. This is because our initial consultation is not
                        just a "meet and greet"—it is a working session. We dedicate office hours to offer professional
                        advice, assess your site or requirements, and provide tangible value right from the start.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do you have a minimum budget requirement?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        No, but the design is heavily dependent on the budget you set. We ask that you take authority on
                        defining your budget early in the process. We then work strictly within those parameters to
                        design a project that is realistic and financially viable for you.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What happens if I don’t like the initial design? Can I make changes?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely. We believe the design must reflect your vision.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Checklist:</strong> We start every project with a rigorous checklist to
                            understand exactly what you like and how you envision the space.</p>
                        <p><strong>Revisions:</strong> We allow design changes up until construction begins.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Generally, we do not charge extra for design revisions during this
                            phase. Extra charges only apply if the changes require site visits beyond the standard
                            requirement.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How long does the design process take?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        The timeline varies by project size. Larger projects require intricate detailing to envision the
                        design fully. We prioritize a thorough design phase because solving details on paper is much
                        cheaper and easier than fixing mistakes on the construction site.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        No. We are Architects, not Contractors. We create the comprehensive "framework"—the detailed
                        designs, drawings, and specifications—that the contractor follows. This ensures the building is
                        constructed exactly according to the vision we created together.

                        <p><strong>Low-Risk Categories:</strong> Yes, we handle the permitting process entirely.</p>
                        <p><strong>Other Categories:</strong> The client is responsible for submitting the application,
                            but we provide all the necessary architectural drawings and technical support to ensure the
                            process goes smoothly.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Our portfolio is diverse. We specialize in Residential, Commercial, Heritage, and Hospitality
                        projects. We tailor our style to the specific needs of the client rather than sticking to one
                        rigid aesthetic.

                        We are headquartered in Kochi, Kerala, but our footprint is expanding rapidly. We currently
                        handle projects across Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. We also work internationally, with
                        active projects in Dubai and Australia.
