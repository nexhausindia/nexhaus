        excerpt: 'A Coastal Sanctuary in Kollam',

In the port city of Kollam, La Casa Blanca stands as a serene departure from conventional residential design. True to its name, this "White House" blends the airy, sun-drenched aesthetics of the Mediterranean with the structural wisdom of Kerala’s colonial and vernacular past.

Because cost was a primary driver, the design language focuses on geometry over demolition. We introduced the Arch as a central motif. By rounding off existing rectangular openings, we completely shifted the home’s character to a refined "Coastal Minimalist" aesthetic without the expense of major structural overhauls.

Design Details: Budget-Smart Elegance
The Power of White: A monochromatic white palette was used to mask structural imperfections, reflect the tropical heat, and create an expensive, airy feel at a low material cost.

Refined Heritage: We opted to refinish rather than replace. The traditional wooden staircase balusters were retained and paired with a modern grey-and-white palette, bridging the gap between old and new.

Natural Textures: To keep costs down while adding warmth, we used cane webbing and timber accents, bringing a tactile, artisanal quality to the minimalist interiors.

Cultural & Historical Significance
Kollam’s colonial maritime history is reflected in the home’s breezy, open feel.

Adaptive Reuse: By choosing to renovate, we honored the home’s history while reducing the environmental impact of new construction.

Modern Vernacular: We retained the traditional sloping clay-tile roof—essential for Kerala’s monsoons—while modernizing the facade to meet a contemporary lifestyle.

La Casa Blanca is proof that great design isn't about the size of the budget, but the cleverness of the intervention.
